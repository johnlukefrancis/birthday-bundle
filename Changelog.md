# Birthday-Bundle Changelog

## Session 5

🟪 **Hydroponic Hero Performance Fix** - Resolved event loop causing water button lag:
- **Issue**: Circular event emission (`PLANT_WATERED` triggering itself in manager)
- **Solution**: Separated concerns - UI emits `PLANT_WATERED`, manager emits `PLANT_STATE_CHANGE`
- **Removed**: Redundant event listeners in PlantRenderer for cleaner event flow
- **Result**: Responsive water button interaction restored in modular architecture

🟦 **Documentation & File Organization**:
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite from scratch, removed all duplicated/corrupted content
- **File Cleanup**: Removed extra main files (main-modular.js, main-new.js, main-original.js, etc.)
- **Service Worker**: Moved to `sw/` folder and updated for modular architecture
- **Enhancement Prompts**: Updated for single-room MVP scope and modular foundation
- **Galaxy Garden Crush**: Created modularization specification (code-only, no features)

🟩 **Game Balance Fix** - Corrected watering amounts that became overpowered during refactoring:
- **Water Button**: Reduced from 20 to 8 hydration points per click
- **Power-up**: Reduced from 30 to 12 hydration points per plant
- **Result**: Balanced gameplay restored - single clicks no longer max out plant hydration

🟩 **Galaxy Garden Crush Modularization Prompt** - Complete specification for match-3 game restructuring:
- **Target**: Transform monolithic structure to ultra-modular event-driven architecture
- **Modules**: Core (engine/state/events), systems (audio/timer/scoring), gameplay (grid/matching/spawning)
- **Pattern**: Following proven Hydroponic Hero modular implementation
- **Timeline**: 55-minute structured implementation with performance considerations
- **Benefits**: Easier maintenance, extensibility, and future feature development

### Session 4

🟪 **Ultra-Modular Architecture Implementation** - Complete codebase restructuring for maximum extensibility:
- **Core Systems**: `js/core/` - engine.js (orchestration), state.js (centralized state), events.js (event bus)
- **Game Systems**: `js/systems/` - audio.js, timer.js, rooms.js (ready for expansion)
- **Plant Logic**: `js/plants/` - manager.js (logic), renderer.js (visuals)
- **UI Systems**: `js/ui/` - screens.js (navigation), overlay.js (modals)
- **Interactions**: `js/interactions/` - input.js (centralized input handling)
- **Asset Structure**: Prepared folders for room backdrops, plant states, UI assets
- **Event-Driven**: Decoupled communication prevents context explosion during expansion
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configs for easy agent modifications

🟦 **ChatGPT Agent Enhancement Prompt - REFINED** - Updated specification for modular foundation:
- Agent now builds on existing ultra-modular architecture instead of refactoring
- Room system foundation already prepared for 4-room expansion
- Plant system designed for room-specific variants and 16-plant scaling
- Asset folders structured for generated images (rooms/, plants/, ui/)
- Event bus enables clean inter-system communication during enhancement
- **Scope**: 45-minute enhancement leveraging pre-built modular foundation

🔧 **Infinite Abyss Coding Agent** 2.9

# Changelog Workflow

- All development changes are tracked in `Changelog.md` in this folder.
- At the end of each session, update `Changelog.md` with a summary of changes and a Next Steps section.
- Previous changelogs can be found in`/Archive` 
- NEW: Prepend entries at TOP of file after this workflow section (improved efficiency)
- ADDITIVE ONLY.
- Use bullet points and emojis for clarity (🟩 new, 🟥 fix, 🟦 improvement, 🟪 refactor).

### Session 4

� **ChatGPT Agent Enhancement Prompt - REFINED** - Expanded specification to room-based gameplay architecture:
- **Core Vision**: Transform from 4-plant grid to room-based hydroponics management (4 rooms × 4 plants each)
- **Room Navigation**: Main deck interface showing room health + click to enter full-screen room environments
- **Image Generation**: Leverage agent's capabilities to generate 4 room backdrops + 48 plant state images
- **Cursor Interaction**: Watering can cursor for direct plant clicking instead of buttons
- **Room Difficulty**: Variable depletion rates per room creating strategic management gameplay
- **Agent Testing**: Mandatory play-testing protocol for balance validation
- **Scope**: Significant architectural enhancement (16 plants vs 4) within 45-minute timeframe
